# CSV Merger Project - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is a CSV processing application for cold email agencies that merges, deduplicates, and standardizes lead data with multi-tenant support.

## Key Documentation Files

### requirements.md
- Contains all user stories and acceptance criteria
- Defines what the application should do from user perspective
- Includes JSON schemas for webhook payloads
- Lists all features: upload, processing, deduplication, webhook/download options, rate control
- Has 12 user stories (US-1 through US-12)

### design.md  
- Technical architecture and system design
- Component structure and class definitions
- API endpoint specifications
- Redis data structures
- Configuration management details
- Technology stack: Flask + Redis + Alpine.js + Tailwind

### implementation-plan.md
- Breaks down development into 24 specific tasks
- Organized in 7 phases from foundation to polish
- Each task has clear objectives and implementation details
- Includes timeline estimates (20-28 days total)
- Task numbering: TASK-1 through TASK-24

## Project Structure (When Built)
- **Backend**: Python Flask with Redis queue
- **Frontend**: Single-page app with Alpine.js + Tailwind
- **Storage**: Session-based file storage (48h cleanup)
- **Multi-tenant**: Session isolation, no database needed
- **Processing**: Smart CSV merging with fuzzy header matching

## Key Features
- Upload multiple CSVs and merge them
- Two processing modes: webhook delivery OR CSV download
- Smart deduplication that combines data from duplicates
- Domain cleaning (removes https, www, etc.)
- Configurable field mappings in JSON files
- Real-time progress tracking
- 48-hour auto-cleanup

## When Implementing
- Follow the spec-driven approach: requirements → design → implementation
- Use the task numbers from implementation-plan.md to track progress
- All session-based features must include session isolation
- Configuration should be easily editable in JSON files
- Always implement both webhook AND download options
